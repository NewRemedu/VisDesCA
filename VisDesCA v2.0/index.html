    <h2>Location</h2>
    <p>Merrion Row was built around Merrion Square after the demand for housing on the southside of the city went up. Three sides of the square are lined with beautiful Georgian houses that were built by the Earl of Kildare at the time. While the other situated Leinster House which is a government building while housing the Natural History Museum and the National Gallery. The most notable person to reside the Merrion Row is Oscar Wilde. He is one of the most famous Irish poets and writers to this day. As you will see below his statue lies in the square. As we are in the middle of City Centre we are surrounding by the immense nightlife of Dublin City </p>
